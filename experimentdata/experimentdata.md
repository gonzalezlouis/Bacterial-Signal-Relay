# Experiment data

In this folder, the data measured from experiments is listed here. This data is necessary for the production of the figures and for the code used in both the simulation and experiment folders. 

The folders are thus:

* changingery: changing the initial concentration amount
* IS-PF-: the control case, no intercellular signaling or positive feedback
* IS-PF+: positive feedback only
* IS+PF-: intercelluar signaling only, also known as pure diffusion
* IS+PF+: intercellular signaling plus positive feedback, also known as the trigger wave
